## Key Features:

- **Personalized Workout Plans:**  
  Get a customized workout split for the week (Push, Pull, Legs, etc.), featuring a range of exercises for each muscle group.

  Log your weights and reps for each exercise, and see your progress over time. Whether you’re improving strength, endurance, or hypertrophy, the app helps you stay consistent.

- **Persistent Data:**  
  Your workout data (weight, reps) is automatically saved, so it’s accessible even after refreshing the page. This ensures you never lose track of your progress.

- **Weekly Reset:**  
  Every week, your exercise checkboxes reset, giving you a fresh start for the new week. However, your weight and rep data are preserved, allowing you to pick up where you left off.

- **Simple and Intuitive:**  
  Easily input your workout details with dedicated fields for weight, reps, and completion status. Mark exercises as complete with checkboxes for a straightforward tracking experience.

- **Active Recovery and Rest Days:**  
  Plan active recovery days (yoga, light cardio) or take full rest as part of your balanced routine to ensure optimal progress.
